export const about = `
Hi, I am a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience, 
and I am passionate about creating solutions that can make a positive 
impact in the real world. A usual day in my schedule involves developing 
business requirements into live features, taking part in architectural 
discussions for feature development, peer reviewing and sometimes hosting 
sessions on various topics for juniors and interns. I am originally from 
Kolkata and currently residing in Bengaluru. At home, one will mostly find 
me spending time with my dog or working on personal projects. Other than 
that, I love to read on various topics ranging from human evolution to 
science fiction. I believe that art is as much important in a personâ€™s 
life as any other field because it helps build the soul while commerce 
and science build the mind.
